# Bash-it

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Bash-it/bash-it.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Bash-it/bash-it) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Bash-it/bash-it](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Bash-it/bash-it?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

**Bash-it** is a collection of community Bash commands and scripts. (And a shameless ripoff of [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) :smiley:)

Includes autocompletion, themes, aliases, custom functions, a few stolen pieces from Steve Losh, and more.

Bash-it provides a solid framework for using, developing and maintaining shell scripts and custom commands for your daily work. If you're using the _Bourne Again Shell_ (Bash) on a regular basis and have been looking for an easy way on how to keep all of these nice little scripts and aliases under control, then Bash-it is for you! Stop polluting your `~/bin` directory and your `.bashrc` file, fork/clone Bash-it and start hacking away.

# Reduced version

These bash-it files are a snapshot of the current state of the bash-it Github repository and are reduced to my needs.
